#### -- Project Status: Active

## Introduction
The purpose of the project is to give the user a probabilistic prediction on the skin disease he/she might have based on the images of the affected part of the skin that the user clicks or uploads from gallery. We have used a MobileNet as the model and trained it on a combination of HAM10000, images sourced from google & manually collected images. Apart from the 10013 images in the HAM10000, we collected around 6000 additional images from the other two strategies.
